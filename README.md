# SMU_MITB

This Repo is created for the submission to SMU MITB.

There's 2 files in this Repo
1. Customer_Segmentation.py is to showcase an unsurpervised learning Model (hierarchy Clustering), used to analyse a dataset of Customers.
The main purpose is to:
    * Identify the best number of segments to split the data set
    * Tag each Customer to a Segment Number.
    * Loop through several parameters to determine the best model and number of clusters to use. Silhouette scoring is the chosen scoring  matrix used.

2. NewDummyData_All.xls contains the data in excel used by Customer_Segmentation.py
